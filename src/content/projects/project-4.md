**Figure**. An example of microRNA in *Rotylenchulus reniformis*, a parasitic nematode of plants, predicted using mirDeep2 and validated with CentroidFold during Klasfeld's summer internship.

## Summary:

* Investigated novel microRNAs in *R. reniformis*

* Assessed AHA and PBJelly as gap closing and scaffold tools for *Medicago truncatula*, a legume of scientific interest due to its symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and fungi, using PacBio sequencing data
