**Figure**. Inherited threshold model of disease describes how common modifiers may influence rare monogenic diseases (Klasfeld *et al* 2014, Kingdom &Wright 2022)

## Summary:

* Organized genetic and medical data leveraged from self-reports, electronic health records, and ~500K exomes in the [UK biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) and generated version-controlled code with [git](https://git-scm.com/) to ensure reproducibility

* Leveraged latest update of [UK biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) to identify a sufficiently sized cohort of known and novel cardiomyopathy variant carriers to improve upon previous studies without adequate statistical power

* Calculated [PRS](https://www.genome.gov/Health/Genomics-and-Medicine/Polygenic-risk-scores) from relevant GWAS and evaluated logistic, cox, and linear regression to quantify the association of common variants on disease penetrance, onset, and severity among the rare pathogenic variant carriers and use the results to provide
genetic insight for decreasing disease outcomes

* Articulated technical genetic study in internal symposiums to showcase my work to multidisciplinary audiences including nonsubject
matter experts (eg. biologists, leadership)
