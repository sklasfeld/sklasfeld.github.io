**Figure**. Casual mutation in disease resistance genes using KASP_*pvr1* and KASP_*Bs3* markers in peppers(Holdsworth & Mazourek 2015)

## Summary:

* Compared Genotype by Sequencing data from different restriction enzymes to *Cucurbita pepo* transcript sequences using BLAST

* Developed and tested KASP markers for relevant genes in peppers to make available for breeding work

* Extracted DNA and utilized PCR and DNA sequencing to determine whether a mutation in a predicted gene was responsible for
the observed phenotype in peppers.
